TODO list for the cps-tools ConPaaS command line command.


* Add a general 'verbose' option. For example::

  $ cps-tools --verbose service start 1
  Service 1 "New PHP service" is starting...

  without the option, it displays nothing::
  
  $ cps-tools service start 1
      # <<< nothing is displayed

* Add a general 'timeout' option:
  cps-tools will fail if it does not get a reply from the director or a service manager
  before the given time.

* Add a 'default_credit' option in the configuration file cps-tools.conf
  to be able to create new user without specifying each time the same credit
  for every new user.
  
* Create several services at once. For example, creating 3 services at once::
  $ cps-tools service create xtreemfs mysql php --cloud=mycloud

  Idem for starting or stopping:
  $ cps-tools service start 2 5 6 --cloud=mycloud
  $ cps-tools service stop 2 1 5

  May be redundant with manifests...

* argcomplete is slow: what about extracting the bash functions dynamically generated by argcomplete
  and storing them in bash_completion.d?

* "cps-tools php start" is an error because we do not specify the service identifier...
  however it should be intelligent and start the only php service that currently does not run.
  It should return a warning if all php services are already running.
  Same for all services.
  Same for stopping.

* Even more object-oriented interface: instead of
    $ cps-tools service start 2 --cloud=mycloud
  better group the service identifier with the 'service' command::
    $ cps-tools service 2 start --cloud=mycloud
    $ cps-tools service "My MySQL service" set_password mypwd
    $ cps-tools application 3 stop
  etc.
