# This file lists the clusters which we want to keep private 
# in some sense. In this case we will include these clusters
# in the aggregate Meta Cluster view, but will not show their
# "cluster view" page without prompting for a password.
#
# These entries are keyed on cluster name, which will become a
# problem if the cluster decides to change theirs.
#
# The password specified here will be used to restrict access
# to the <Cluster Name> detailed pages. The username of the
# HTTP 401 dialog box will not matter.
#
# The password is stored in an MD5 hash. It is theorized that 
# obtaining the original string from an MD5 hash is impossible 
# (NP-hard). Create the hash with the command:
#
# echo -n "password" | md5sum
#
# Where "password" is your desired password.
#
# The format of the private_cluster file is
# <Cluster Name>=<MD5 Password>
#
# Whitespace on either end of the name and passwords are stripped.
#

#My Cluster = 918b81db5e91d031548b963c93845e5b

#
# The control room view (specified with cr=n or cr=-n CGI variable)
# requires a password with key "controlroom". The control room has
# access to all clusters, even private ones.
#
# default "admin"
