Talk about vertical and horizontal scaling
Measuring instance performance
Multi instance infrastrucutres

Even if we use two level threshold there are traffic oscillations which cannot be handled by the system due to minimal variations. These minimal oscillations can sometimes be higher than the own infrastructure cost and degradate the user experience. In this paper, we try to minimize these by using a heterogonouer resource provisioning system. the cost of the infrastructure

Contribution:
App metrics instead of other system which hare limited to VM-level metrics. (Pluggable autoscaling service)
Real application and traces
Cost considerations.
Decision making scaling up/down out/in.
Dynamic load balancing
Measuring instance performance without additional resources

SLO fulfillment in order to avoid the cost of slo penalties.
Type of machines
SLO penalty -- different type of customers

Explain what is a scaling plan
