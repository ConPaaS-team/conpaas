multi cloud deployments, support for more types of instances.
Online profiling

Our experiments focus on a small scenario, however. The benefits of our approach could also be observed along the whole execution of a workload trace as it is also works for small oscillations of traffic.

It is necessary to highlight the impotance of autoscaling systems that exploits the heterogeneity of the cloud infrastructures when provisioning applications.

cheapest configuration doesn't have to be efficient. Tradittional system scale out and back using small instances.

Minimize the SLO can reduce the revenues and improve other aspects such as user experiences when talking of large entreprises such as Facebook, amazon ....

Runtime Load balancing .. improvement
