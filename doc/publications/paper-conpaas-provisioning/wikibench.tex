Describe the application and the workload traces: 


\begin{itemize}
\item structure of the Mediawiki application
\item content and size of the DB
\item the access traces and how Wikibench works
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item the PHP pages take significantly more time to process
than the web pages
\item each PHP page needs a lot of DB queries 
\item the pages vary in complexity so it is difficult to make
predictions (maybe compute the standard deviation of the response time
from a trace to show this)
\end{itemize}
