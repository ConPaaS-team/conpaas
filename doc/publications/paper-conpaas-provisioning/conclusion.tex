\lettrine{E}{xcesive} reactive algorithms tend to temporally overprovision applications affected by flashcrowds or slashdot effects. This type of algorithms increase the resource consumption and infrastructure costs than other ...

Experiments based on real-traces "Wikipedia" and conducted on heterogeneous and homogeneous cloud infrastructures. 

The use of offline-profiling techniques allow to identify the threshold of the resources of a cloud infrastructure. 

The provisioning system remains independent of the infrastructure on which the apps run.
