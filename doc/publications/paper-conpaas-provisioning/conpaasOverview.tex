ConPaaS is an open-source runtime environment for hosting applications in Cloud infrastructures~\cite{conpaasIC}.
Within the Cloud computing paradigm, ConPaaS belongs to the platform-as-a-service family, 
in which a variety of systems aim to simplify the deployment of applications in the Cloud. Using ConPaaS,  developers can now focus their attention on application-specific concerns rather than making their applications suitable for the cloud. 

\subsection*{Architecture}

In ConPaaS, an application is designed as a composition of one or more elastic and distributed components, called \emph{services}. Each service is dedicated to host a particular type of functionality of an application. At the moment, ConPaaS supports six different types of services: two web application hosting services respectively specialized for hosting PHP and JSP applications; a MySQL database service; a NoSQL database service built around the Scalarix key-value store; a MapReduce service; and a TaskFarming service for high-performance batch processing.  
%Figure~\ref{arch} shows ConPaaS hosting an application composed of a PhP service and a MySQL service, that could represents the architecture of any today's web application.

The architecture of ConPaaS services comprises two main building blocks: agents and managers.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Agent}: The agent VMs (virtual machines) host the needed components to provide the service-specific functionality. Based on the performance requirements or the application workload, the number of agent VMs hosting these components can grow or shrink on demand. Thus, as an example, the minimal configuration of the PHP web hosting service consists of a single agent VM. If necessary,
the service can progressively grow to multiple agent VMs hosting its components: load-balancer, web servers for static pages and/or PHP servers for dynamic pages. 
\item \textbf{Manager}: For each service, there is only one manager VM. The manager is in charge of centralizing monitoring data and controlling the allocation of resources assigned to the service. 
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{arch} shows the architecture of the ConPaaS deployment for a 
typical PHP web application backed by a MySQL database. The application is
deployed using two ConPaaS services: the PHP service and the MySQL service.

%On the other hand, in ConPaaS, there are two types of traffic: application and management. The application traffic is based on requests from end users willing to access the application, so that is addressed to the agents hosting such application.  On the other hand, the management traffic is directed from the service administrators to their service managers, and from those to the agents.  Service administrators can manage their services using a graphical front-end or a command-line tool.  

\subsection*{Hosting Elastic Applications}

The main features that distinguish ConPaaS from other PaaS systems are its approach for autonomous application scaling and its interoperability with several private and public IaaS clouds. To provide such autonomous scaling capabilities, ConPaaS includes a monitoring data analysis mechanism  and a resource provisioning system.

%ConPaaS incorporates a scalable distributed monitoring engine which is based on the Ganglia~\cite{ganglia} monitoring system. Ganglia consists of a server component (gmetad) that aggregates monitoring statistics from various VMs, and a reporting agent (gmond) which runs inside each VM. By default, Ganglia monitors only system-level metrics such as disk, CPU, memory and network usage. Unfortunately, these metrics often do not provide enough information about system performance due to the heterogeneity of the applications. As a consequence, in ConPaaS, we enhanced ganglia to also monitor service workloads by enhancing the reporting agent to track service-specific logs at runtime, and report statistics over a reporting period of 5 minutes. For instance, the PhP web hosting service includes new ganglia metrics that report statistics about the response time and request rate for static and dynamic user requests, respectively. Once the monitoring data is collected from the agents VMs, the resource provisioning  algorithm decides whether to trigger scaling operations based on this data. 

For monitoring in ConPaas we used Ganglia~\cite{ganglia}, a scalable 
distributed monitoring system. The monitoring data is collected by
the manager VM, which runs for this purpose a Ganglia meta daemon
(gmetad). We implemented modules that extend Ganglia's standard
set of monitoring metrics, by adding a number of service-specific
metrics. For the PHP web hosting service, we added monitoring metrics
for measuring the request rate and response time both at the static web
server and at the PHP server.

%Unlike of implementing traditional trigger-based provisioning systems that scale services independently of whether they are part of an application. In ConPaaS, we designed a performance control model for multi-service applications. Using this model, the performance requirements are only imposed to the front-end service, while all the services collaborate in order to guarantee them. It improves the effectiveness and accuracy of the scaling decisions. Indeed, this allows to rapidly detect performance bottlenecks in applications, and thereby to minimize the resource consumption.

Our approach for automatic resource provisioning is to implement
customized scaling policies for each type of service, taking
into account the particularities of the service (e.g. the structure
of the service deployment, the complexity of the requests etc.)
and also the service-specific monitoring data. So far our focus 
has been on the web hosting service, for which we implemented a number of
automatic resource provisioning mechanisms.

% Instead of implementing simple performance-based triggers which provision each tier individually based on %its own performance, we designed a performance control model for the entire application. 


%Ganglia stores monitored statistics in a custom roundrobin database (RRD); our monitoring engine can track %resource usage and application workload statistics by periodically querying this database and determining %whether any user-specified thresholds have been exceeded (e.g., thresholds on SLA violations, request %drops, or resource utilization).
