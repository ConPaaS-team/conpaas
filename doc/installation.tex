\section{Installation Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

\xlink{ConPaaS}{http://www.conpaas.eu} is composed of two parts: a web service,
called \textbf{cpsdirector}, and a web front-end. The web service implements a
restful API which is used by the ConPaaS command line tools and by the web
front-end.

Both the director and the front-end can run inside or outside the cloud.
ConPaaS services are designed to run either in an OpenNebula cloud
installation or in the Amazon Web Services cloud.

Installing ConPaaS requires to take the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose a VM image customized for hosting the services, or create a new
one. Details on how to do this vary depending on the choice of cloud where
ConPaaS will run. Instructions on how to find or create a ConPaaS image
suitable to run on Amazon EC2 can be found in Section~\ref{sec:ec2image}. 
Section~\ref{sec:oneimage} describes how to create a ConPaaS image for OpenNebula.
\item Setup and configure the ConPaaS director. All system
  configuration takes place in the director. Director installation and
  configuration is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:director}.
\item Install the ConPaaS front-end and configure it to use your ConPaaS
  director as explained in Section~\ref{sec:frontend}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Using ConPaaS on Amazon EC2}
\label{sec:ec2image}

The Web Hosting Service is capable of running over the Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2) of Amazon Web Services (AWS). This section describes the
process of configuring an AWS account to run the Web Hosting Service.
You can skip this section if you plan to install ConPaaS over
OpenNebula.

If you are new to EC2, you will need to create an account at
\url{http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/}. A very good introduction to EC2 can be found
at \url{http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/GettingStartedGuide/}.

\subsection{Pre-built EBS Amazon Machine Image}

The Web Hosting Service requires the usage of an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to
contain the dependencies of its processes. For your convenience we provide a
pre-built public AMI, already configured and ready to be used on Amazon EC2,
for each availability zone supported by ConPaaS. The AMI IDs of said images
are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb+ami-4055db70+ United States West (Oregon)
    \item \verb+ami-4b249322+ United States East (Northern Virginia)
    \item \verb+ami-db0a0ba+ Europe West (Ireland)
\end{itemize}

You can use one of these values when configuring your ConPaaS director
installation as described in Section~\ref{sec:director}.

\subsection{Create an EBS backed AMI on Amazon EC2}

Using pre-built Amazon Machine Images is the recommended way of running ConPaaS
on Amazon EC2, as described in the previous section. However, you can also
create a new Elastic Block Store backed Amazon Machine Image yourself, for example
in case you wish to run ConPaaS in a different Availability Zone.
The easiest way to do that is to start from an already existing AMI, customize
it and save the resulting filesystem as a new image. The following steps explains
how to setup an AMI using this methodology.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Log in the AWS management console, select the ``EC2'' tab, then ``AMIs''
in the left-side menu. Search the public AMIs for a Debian Squeeze EBS AMI and
start an instance of it. If you are going to use micro-instances then the AMI
with ID \verb+ami-e0e11289+ in the US East zone could be a good choice.

\item Upload the \textit{conpaas-services/scripts/create\_vm/ec2-setup-new-vm-image.sh} script to the instance:
  \begin{verbatim}
    chmod 0400 yourpublickey.pem
    scp -i yourpublickey.pem \
      conpaas-services/scripts/create_vm/ec2-setup-new-vm-image.sh \
      root@instancename.com:
  \end{verbatim}

\item Now, ssh to your instance:
  \begin{verbatim}
    ssh -i yourpublickey.pem root@your.instancename.com
  \end{verbatim}
  Run the \verb+ec2-setup-new-vm-image.sh+ script inside the instance.
  This script will install all of the dependencies of the manager and
  agent processes as well as create the necessary directory structure.

\item Clean the filesystem by removing the
  \verb+ec2-setup-new-vm-image.sh+ file and any other temporary files you might
  have created.

\item Go to the EC2 administration page at the AWS website, right
  click on the running instance and select ``\emph{Create Image (EBS
    AMI)}''.  This step will take several minutes. More information about this step
 can be found at
  \url{http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/index.html?Tutorial\_CreateImage.html}.

\item After the image has been fully created, you can return to the
  EC2 dashboard, right-click on your instance, and terminate it.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Create a Security Group}
\label{sec:secgroup}

An AWS security group is an abstraction of a set of firewall rules to
limit inbound traffic. The default policy of a new group is to deny
all inbound traffic. Therefore, one needs to specify a whitelist of
protocols and destination ports that are accessible from the outside. 
The following ports should be open for all running instances: 
\begin{itemize}
\item TCP ports 80, 443, 5555, 8000, 8080 and 9000 -- used by the Web Hosting service
\item TCP port 3306 -- used by the MySQL service
\item TCP ports 8020, 8021, 8088, 50010, 50020, 50030, 50060, 50070, 50075, 50090, 50105, 54310 and 54311 -- used by the Map Reduce service
\item TCP ports 4369, 14194 and 14195 -- used by the Scalarix service
\item TCP ports 8475, 8999 -- used by the TaskFarm service
\item TCP ports 32636, 32638 and 32640 -- used by the XtreemFS service
\end{itemize}

AWS documentation is available at
\url{http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/index.html?using-network-security.html}.

\section{Creating a ConPaaS image for OpenNebula}
\label{sec:oneimage}

The Web Hosting Service is capable of running over an OpenNebula
installation. This section describes the process of configuring
OpenNebula to run ConPaaS. You can skip this section if you plan to
deploy ConPaaS over Amazon Web Services.

To create an image for OpenNebula you can execute the script\\
\textit{conpaas-services/scripts/create\_vm/opennebula-create-new-vm-image.sh}
in any 64-bit Debian or Ubuntu machine. Please note that you will need to have
root privileges on such a system. In case you do not have root access to a
Debian or Ubuntu machine please consider installing a virtual machine using
your favorite virtualization technology, or running a Debian/Ubuntu instance in
the cloud.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make sure your system has the following executables installed
  (they are usually located in \verb+/sbin+ or \verb+/usr/sbin+, so
  make sure these directories are in your \verb+$PATH+): % $
  \emph{dd parted losetup kpartx mkfs.ext3 tune2fs mount debootstrap
    chroot umount grub-install}
\item It is particularly important that you use Grub version 2. To
  install it:
  \begin{verbatim}
  sudo apt-get install grub2
  \end{verbatim}
\item Edit the
  \textit{conpaas-services/scripts/create\_vm/opennebula-create-new-vm-image.sh} script
  if necessary: there are two sections in the script that you might need
  to customize with parameters that are specific to your system. These
  sections are marked by comment lines containing the text "TO CUSTOMIZE:".
  There are comments explaining each customizable parameter. 
\item Obtain the id of the OpenNebula datastore you want to use by running
  \verb+onedatastore list+. In the following example, we will use "100" as our datastore id.
\item Execute the image generation script as root.
\item The script generates an image file called \verb+conpaas.img+ by default.
You can now register it in OpenNebula, replacing '100' in this example with the
datastore id obtained with \verb+onedatastore list+.

\vspace{10 mm}

\begin{verbatim}
  cat <<EOF > /tmp/conpaas-one.image
  NAME          = "Conpaas"
  PATH          = ${PWD}/conpaas.img
  PUBLIC        = YES
  DESCRIPTION   = "Conpaas vm image"
  EOF
  oneimage create /tmp/conpaas-one.image -d 100
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}
% $>

\paragraph{If things go wrong}~\\

Note that if anything fails during the image file creation, the script will
stop and it will try to revert any change it has done. However, it might not
always reset your system to its original state. To undo everything the script
has done, follow these instructions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The image has been mounted as a separate file system. Find the
  mounted directory using command \verb+df -h+. The directory should
  be in the form of \verb+/tmp/tmp.X+.
  
\item There may be a \verb+dev+ and a \verb+proc+ directories mounted
  inside it. Unmount everything using:
  \begin{verbatim}
    sudo umount /tmp/tmp.X/dev /tmp/tmp.X/proc /tmp/tmp.X
  \end{verbatim}
  
\item Find which loop device your using:
  \begin{verbatim}
    sudo losetup -a
  \end{verbatim}
  
\item Remove the device mapping:
  \begin{verbatim}
    sudo kpartx -d /dev/loopX
  \end{verbatim}
  
\item Remove the binding of the loop device:
  \begin{verbatim}
    sudo losetup -d /dev/loopX
  \end{verbatim}

\item Delete the image file 

\item Your system should be back to its original state.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Make sure OpenNebula is properly configured}

OpenNebula's OCCI daemon is used by ConPaaS to communicate with your
OpenNebula cluster.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Ensure your occi-server.conf contains the following lines in instance\_types:
\begin{verbatim}
:custom:
  :template: custom.erb
\end{verbatim}
\item At the end of the OCCI profile file \verb+occi_templates/common.erb+ 
  from your OpenNebula installation, add the content of the file
  \verb+misc/common.erb+ from the ConPaaS distribution. This new version 
  features a number of improvements from the standard version:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The match for \verb+OS TYPE:arch+ allows the caller to specify
    the architecture of the machine.
  \item The graphics line allows for using vnc to connect to the VM.
    This is very useful for debugging purposes and is not necessary
    once testing is complete.

  \end{itemize}

\item Make sure you started OpenNebula's OCCI daemon

\end{enumerate}

\section{Install and configure the ConPaaS Director}
\label{sec:director}

The ConPaaS Director is a web service that allows users to manage their ConPaaS
services. Users can create, configure and terminate services through it. This
section describes the process of setting up a ConPaaS director on a Debian (or
Ubuntu) system.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Install the following packages: build-essential, python-setuptools
  python-dev, libapache2-mod-wsgi, and libcurl4-openssl-dev
\item Download \url{http://www.conpaas.eu/dl/cpsdirector-1.1.0.tar.gz} and uncompress it
\item Run make install as root
\item Edit /etc/cpsdirector/director.cfg providing your cloud configuration
\end{enumerate}

The installation process will create the Apache configuration for the ConPaaS
director in /etc/apache2/sites-available/conpaas-director. Please inspect this
file and modify it according to your needs.

Then, run the following commands to enable the newly created configuration:

\begin{verbatim}
a2enmod ssl
a2ensite conpaas-director
service apache2 reload
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Important note on SSL certificates}
ConPaaS uses SSL certificates in order to secure the communication between you
and the director, but also to ensure that only authorized parties such as
yourself and the various component of ConPaaS can interact with the system.

It is therefore crucial that the SSL certificate of your director contains the
proper information. In particular, the commonName field of the certificate
should carry the public hostname of your frontend server. The installation
procedure takes care of setting up such a field. However, should your director
hostname change, please ensure you run the following commands:

\begin{verbatim}
sudo cpsconf.py
sudo service apache2 restart
\end{verbatim}

\section{Setup ConPaaS's Frontend}
\label{sec:frontend}

The ConPaaS Frontend can be downloaded from
\url{http://www.conpaas.eu/dl/cpsfrontend-1.1.0.tar.gz}.

After having uncompressed it you should:

\begin{itemize}
\item Install the libapache2-mod-php5 and php5-curl Debian packages
\item Copy all the files contained in the \textbf{www} directory underneath your web server document root
\item Copy \textbf{conf/main.ini} and \textbf{conf/welcome.txt} in a directory
  outside of the web server directory. Such a directory must contain your
  Director's certificates under a subdirectory called \textbf{certs}.
\item Create a config.php file. Please refer to
  config-example.php for a detailed explaination of all the configuration
  options. Note that config.php must contain the CONPAAS\_CONF\_DIR option,
  pointing to the directory mentioned in the previous step.
\end{itemize}

At this point, your front-end should be working!

\section{Miscellaneous}
\label{sec:misc}

\subsection{The credit system}

The frontend is designed to maintain accounting of resources used by
each user. When a new user is created, (s)he receives a number of
credits as specified in the ``main.ini'' configuration file. Later on,
one credit is subtracted each time a VM is executed for (a fraction
of) one hour. The administrator can change the number of credits by
directly editing the frontend's database. 

\subsection{Application sandboxing}

The default ConPaaS configuration creates strong sandboxing so that
applications cannot open sockets, access the file system, execute
commands, etc. This makes the platform relatively secure against
malicious applications. On the other hand, it strongly restricts the
actions that ConPaaS applications can do. To reduce these security
measures to a more usable level, you need to edit two files:

\begin{itemize}
\item To change restrictions applied to PHP applications, edit file
  \verb+web-servers/etc/fpm.tmpl+ to change the list of
  \verb+disable\_functions+. Do not forget to recreate a file
  \verb+ConPaaSWeb.tar.gz+ out of the entire \verb+web-servers+
  directory, and to copy it at the URL specified in file
  \verb+frontend/conf/manager-user-data+.
\item To change restrictions applied to Java applications, edit file
  ``web-servers/etc/tomcat-catalina.policy''. Do not forget to
  recreate a file ConPaaSWeb.tar.gz out of the entire ``web-servers''
  directory, and to copy it at the URL specified in file
  ``frontend/conf/manager-user-data''.
\end{itemize}
