================================================
Extract the ConPaaS API from ConPaaS source code
================================================

--------------
API definition
--------------

This script extracts the ConPaaS API based on decorated Python functions.

In the director's code, a function that is part of the API is decorated with a
call to:

  @<http_page>.route(<entry_name>, methods=[<http_method_list>])
  def entry():
      """
      <entry_documentation>
      """
      ...

In the managers' and agents' code, a function is part of the API when decorated
with a call to:

  @expose(<http_method>)
  def entry():
      """
      <entry_documentation>
      """
      ...

----------------------------------
Generating the API with the script
----------------------------------

In the usual ConPaaS source code configuration, just run the script that will
use the relative default director, managers, and agents source code location:

    ./extract_api.sh

Set different source code locations by editing in the script the definitions of
variables 'director_src' and 'services_src'.

By default, output is generated in directory ./gen_api:
    ./gen_api/odt/director.odt
    ./gen_api/odt/services.odt
    ./gen_api/latex/services.pdf
    ./gen_api/latex/director.pdf
