Thank you for registering a new ConPaaS account! This platform will let you deploy Web and scientific applications in the Cloud in one click, and control the amount of resources used by your application in another click. 

You now have 10 credits: this means we offer you 10 hours of virtual instances running in the Cloud. This should be enough for trying out the system, but you may find it limiting to host a real application on a continuous basis. If you want to keep on using ConPaaS after your credit has expired, do not hesitate to get in touch with me. Please note that, as long as you have a service in the system (even a stopped one), you are using credit.

To get started you may want to click on \"help\" on the top-right of the page where you can find a user manual and a few examples of applications you can deploy in the system.

Good luck with ConPaaS, and do not hesitate to let me know if you have any question!
