conpaas-director
================

This application allows to start and stop ConPaaS service managers. The idea is
that once a manager is running, every subsequent operation can be done directly
through the manager.

Installation 
------------
The following Debian packages are required in order to use ConPaaS. 

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential python-setuptools python-dev libapache2-mod-wsgi libcurl4-openssl-dev autoconf

Run "make install" as root. 

Provide your cloud credentials in /etc/cpsdirector/director.cfg.

The installation procedure will create an Apache configuration file for the
Director. Please make sure it matches with your desired setup:
/etc/apache2/sites-available/conpaas-director.conf

Make sure ssl is enabled:
$ sudo a2enmod ssl

Enable the conpaas-director config:
$ sudo a2ensite conpaas-director.conf

Restart apache:
$ sudo service apache2 restart

Usage
-----
To use the director you need to install the ConPaaS command line clients.

$ sudo easy_install http://www.conpaas.eu/dl/cpsclient-1.2.1.tar.gz

That command should bring in all the required dependencies. The client
can then be used by regular users. Usage output can be displayed by
running:

$ cpsclient.py help

To install the CLI clients as non-root users you need virtualenv:

$ virtualenv test # create the virtualenv
$ cd test
$ source bin/activate # activate it
$ easy_install http://www.conpaas.eu/dl/cpsclient-1.2.1.tar.gz
