conpaas-director
================

This application allows to start and stop ConPaaS service managers. The idea is
that once a manager is running, every subsequent operation can be done directly
through the manager.

Installation 
------------
The following Debian packages are required in order to use ConPaaS. 

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential python-setuptools python-dev libapache2-mod-wsgi libcurl4-openssl-dev

Run "make install" as root. 

Provide your cloud credentials in /etc/cpsdirector/director.cfg.

Restart apache.

Usage
-----
New services can easily be started via curl:
    curl --cacert ca_cert.pem -d "username=user&password=pass" https://director.example.org/start/php

Stopped:
    curl --cacert ca_cert.pem -d "username=user&password=pass" https://director.example.org/stop/1

And listed:
    curl --cacert ca_cert.pem "https://director.example.org/list?username=user&password=pass"
