<h1><a name="id1">1 Introduction</a></h1><p>
<a href="http://www.conpaas.eu">ConPaaS</a> is an open-source runtime
environment for hosting applications in the cloud which aims at
offering the full power of the cloud to application developers while
shielding them from the associated complexity of the cloud.
</p>
<p>ConPaaS is designed to host both high-performance scientific
applications and online Web applications. It runs on a variety of
public and private clouds, and is easily extensible.  ConPaaS
automates the entire life-cycle of an application, including
collaborative development, deployment, performance monitoring, and
automatic scaling. This allows developers to focus their attention on
application-specific concerns rather than on cloud-specific details.
</p>
<p>ConPaaS is organized as a collection of <b>services</b>, where each
service acts as a replacement for a commonly used runtime environment.
For example, to replace a MySQL database, ConPaaS provides a
cloud-based MySQL service which acts as a high-level database
abstraction. The service uses real MySQL databases internally, and
therefore makes it easy to port an cloud application to ConPaaS.
Unlike a regular centralized database, however, it is self-managed and
fully elastic: one can dynamically increase or decrease its processing
capacity by requesting it to reconfigure itself with a different
number of virtual machines.
</p>
<p>ConPaaS currently contains six services: 
</p>
<ul><li><b>Two Web hosting services</b> respectively specialized for
hosting PHP and JSP applications;
</li><li><b>MySQL database</b> service;
</li><li><b>Scalarix service</b> offering a scalable in-memory
key-value store;
</li><li><b>MapReduce service</b> providing thewell-known
high-performance computation framework;
</li><li><b>TaskFarming service</b> high-performance batch processing.
</li></ul>
<p>ConPaaS applications can be composed of any number of services. For
example, a bio-informatics application may make use of a PHP and a
MySQL service to host a Web-based frontend, and link this frontend to
a MapReduce backend service for conducting high-performance genomic
computations on demand.
</p>

<h1><a name="id2">2 ConPaaS usage overview</a></h1><p>
Most operations in ConPaaS can be done using the ConPaaS frontend,
which gives a Web-based interface to the system. The front-end allows
users to register, create services, upload code and data to the
services, and configure each service. 
</p>
<ul><li>The Dashboard page displays the list of services currently
active in the system. 
</li><li>Each service comes with a separate page which allows one to
configure it, upload code and data, and scale it up and down.
</li></ul>
<p>All the functionalities of the frontend are also available using a
command-line interface. This allows one to script commands for
ConPaaS. The command-line interface also features additional advanced
functionalities, which are not available using the front-end.
</p>

<h2><a name="id3">2.1 Controlling services using the front-end</a></h2><p>
The ConPaaS front-end provides a simple and intuitive interface for
controlling services. We discuss here the features that are common to
all services, and refer to the next sections for service-specific
functionality.
</p>
<dl><dt>Create a service.</dt><dd> Click on "create new service", then select
the service you want to create. This operation starts a new
"Manager" virtual machine instance. The manager is in charge of
taking care of the service, but it does not host applications
itself. Other instances in charge of running the actual application
are called "agent" instances.
</dd><dt>Start a service.</dt><dd> Click on "start", this will create a new
virtual machine which can host applications, depending on the type
of service.
</dd><dt>Rename the service.</dt><dd> By default all new services are named "New
service." To give a meaningful name to a service, click on this
name in the service-specific page and enter a new name.
</dd><dt>Check the list of virtual instances.</dt><dd> A service can run using
one or more virtual machine instances. The service-specific page
shows the list of instances, their respective IP addresses, and the
role each instance is currently having in the service. Certain
services use a single role for all instances, while other services
specialize different instances to take different roles. For example,
the PHP Web hosting service distinguishes three roles: load
balancers, web servers, and PHP servers.
</dd><dt>Scale the service up and down.</dt><dd> When a service is started it
uses a single "agent" instance. To add more capacity, or to later
reduce capacity you can vary the number of instances used by the
service. Click the numbers below the list of instances to request
adding or removing servers. The system reconfigures itself without
any service interruption.
</dd><dt>Stop the service.</dt><dd> When you do not need to run the application
any more, click "stop" to stop the service. This stops all
instances except the manager which keeps on running. 
</dd><dt>Terminate the service.</dt><dd> Click "terminate" to terminate the
service. At this point all the state of the service manager will be
lost.
</dd></dl>

<h2><a name="id4">2.2 Controlling services using the command-line interfaces</a></h2><p>
Command-line interfaces allow one to control services without using
the graphical interface. The command-likne interfaces also offer
additional functionality for advanced usage of the services.
</p>
<p>Each service can be controlled using its own command-line tool:
</p>
<ul><li>The two Web hosting services are controlled using <tt>cpsclient.web</tt>
</li><li>The MySQL service is controlled using <tt>cpsclient.mysql</tt>
</li><li>The Scalarix service is controlled using <tt>cpsclient.scalarix</tt>
</li><li>The MapReduce service is controlled using cpsclient.mapreduce
</li></ul>
<p>To use these tools you must first set the PYTHONPATH variable to
contain the full path name of the "src" subdirectory within the
ConPaaS directory:
</p>
<pre>
$ export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/conpaas/src
</pre>
<p>The <tt>cpsclient.*</tt> tools always take the URL of the service
manager as its first argument. This URL is provided by the front-end.
</p>
<dl><dt>List all options of the command-line tool.</dt><dd>&nbsp;
<pre>
$ ./cpsclient.servicename help
</pre>
</dd><dt>Start the service.</dt><dd>&nbsp;
<pre>
$ ./cpsclient.servicename http://x-x-x-x/ startup
</pre>
</dd><dt>Stop the service.</dt><dd>&nbsp;
<pre>
$ ./cpsclient.servicename http://x-x-x-x/ shutdown
</pre>
</dd><dt>Scale the service up and down.</dt><dd>&nbsp;
<pre>
$ ./cpsclient.servicename http://x-x-x-x/ add_nodes -h
$ ./cpsclient.servicename http://x-x-x-x/ remove_nodes -h
$ ./cpsclient.web http://x-x-x-x/ add_nodes -w 1 -b 1
$ ./cpsclient.web http://x-x-x-x/ remove_nodes -w 1 -b 1
</pre>
</dd></dl>

<h2><a name="id5">2.3 The credit system</a></h2><p>
In Cloud computing, resources come at a cost. ConPaaS reflects this
reality in the form of a credit system. Each user is given a number of
credits that she can use as she wishes. One credit corresponds to one
hour of execution of one virtual machine. The number of available
credits is always mentioned in the top-right corner of the front-end.
Once credits are exhausted, your running instances will be stopped and
you will not be able to use the system until the administrator decides
to give additional credit.
</p>
<p>Note that every service consumes credit, even if it is in "stopped"
state. The reason is that stopped services still have one "manager"
instance running. To stop using credits you must completely terminate
your services.
</p>

<h1><a name="id6">3 Tutorial: hosting WordPress in ConPaaS</a></h1><p>
This short tutorial illustrates the way to use ConPaaS to install and
host WordPress (<a href="www.wordpress.org">www.wordpress.org</a>), a well-known third-party Web
application. WordPress is implemented in PHP using a MySQL database so
we will need a PHP and a MySQL service in ConPaaS.
</p>
<ol><li>Open the ConPaaS front-end in your Web browser and log in. If
necessary, create yourself a user account and make sure that you
have at least 5 credits. Your credits are always shown in the
top-right corner of the front-end. One credit corresponds to one
hour of execution of one virtual machine instance.
</li><li>Create a MySQL service, start it, reset its password. Copy the
IP address of the master node somewhere, we will need it in step 5.
</li><li>Create a PHP service, start it.
</li><li>Download a Wordpress tarball from <a href="www.wordpress.org">www.wordpress.org</a>, and
expand it in your computer.
</li><li>Copy file wordpress/wp-config-sample.php to
wordpress/wp-config.php and edit the <tt>DB&#95;NAME</tt>,
<tt>DB&#95;USER</tt>, <tt>DB&#95;PASSWORD</tt> and <tt>DB&#95;HOST</tt>
variables to point to the database service. You can choose any
database name for the <tt>DB&#95;NAME</tt> variable as long as it does
not contain any special character. We will reuse the same name in
step 7.
</li><li>Rebuild a tarball of the directory such that it will expand in
the current directory rather than in a <tt>wordpress</tt>
subdirectory. Upload this tarball to the PHP service, and make the
new version active. 
</li><li>Connect to the database using the command proposed by the
frontend. Create a database of the same name as in step 5 using
command "<tt>CREATE DATABASE databasename;</tt>"
</li><li>Open the page of the PHP service, and click "access
application." Your browser will display nothing because the
application is not fully installed yet. Visit the same site at URL
http://xxx.yyy.zzz.ttt/wp-admin/install.php and fill in the
requested information (site name etc).
</li><li>That's it! The system works, and can be scaled up and down. 
</li></ol>
<p>Note that the "file upload" functionality of WordPress will not work
if you scale the system up. This is because WordPress stores files in
the local file system of the PHP server where the upload has been
processed. If a subsequent request for this file is processed by
another PHP server then the file will not be found. In a next ConPaaS
release we wil provide a shared file system service which will allow
one to avoid this issue.
</p>

<h1><a name="id7">4 The PHP Web hosting service</a></h1><p>
The PHP Web hosting service is dedicated to hosting Web applications
written in PHP. It can also host static Web content.
</p>

<h2><a name="id8">4.1 Uploading application code</a></h2><p>
PHP applications can be uploaded in the form of a <tt>tar</tt> or
<tt>zip</tt> archive.  Attention: the archive must expand <em>in the
current directory</em> rather than in a subdirectory. The service does
not immediately use new applications when they are uploaded. The
frontend shows the list of versions that have been uploaded; choose
one version and click "make active" to activate it.
</p>
<p>Note that the frontend only allows uploading archives smaller than a
certain size.  To upload large archives, you must use the command-line
tool:
</p>
<pre>
$ ./cpsclient.web http://x-x-x-x/ upload_code_version path/to/archive.zip
</pre>

<h2><a name="id9">4.2 Access the application</a></h2><p>
The frontend gives a link to the running application. This URL will
remain valid as long as you do not stop the service.
</p>

<h2><a name="id10">4.3 Using PHP sessions</a></h2><p>
PHP normally stores session state in its main memory. When scaling up
the PHP service, this creates problems because multiple PHP servers
running in different VM instances cannot share their memory. To
support PHP sessions the PHP service features a key-value store where
session states can be transparently stored. To overwrite PHP session
functions such that they make use of the shared key-value store, the PHP
service includes a .php file to the beginning of each .php file of your
application that uses sessions, i.e. in which function session&#95;start()
is encountered:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;?php
  require_once '/path/to/phpsession.php';
?&gt;
</pre>
<p>This file, called phpsessions.php, overwrittes the session handlers using the
session&#95;set&#95;save&#95;handler() function.
</p>
<p>Although this modification should not affect your application, please be aware
of it.
</p>

<h2><a name="id11">4.4 Debug mode</a></h2><p>
By default the PHP service does not display anything in case PHP
errors occur while executing the application. This setting is useful
for production, when you do not want to reveal internal information to
external users. While developing an application it is however useful
to let PHP display erors.
</p>
<pre>
$ ./cpsclient.web http://x-x-x-x/ update_php_configuration \
  -p "display_errors=On" 
</pre>

<h1><a name="id12">5 The Java Web hosting service</a></h1><p>
The Java Web hosting service is dedicated to hosting Web applications
written in Java using JSP or servlets. It can also host static Web
content.
</p>

<h2><a name="id13">5.1 Uploading application code</a></h2><p>
Applications in the Java Web hosting service can be uploaded in the
form of a <tt>war</tt> file. The service does not immediately use new
applications when they are uploaded. The frontend shows the list of
versions that have been uploaded; choose one version and click "make
active" to activate it.  
</p>
<p>Note that the frontend only allows uploading archives smaller than a
certain size.  To upload large archives, you must use the command-line
tool.
</p>
<pre>
$ ./cpsclient.web http://x-x-x-x/ upload_code_version path/to/archive.war
</pre>

<h2><a name="id14">5.2 Access your application</a></h2><p>
The frontend gives a link to the running application. This URL will
remain valid as long as you do not stop the service.
</p>

<h1><a name="id15">6 The MySQL database service</a></h1><p>
The MySQL service provides the famous database in the form of a
ConPaaS service. When scaling the service up and down, it creates (or
deletes) database replicas using the master-slave mechanism. At the
moment, the service does not implement load balancing of database
queries between the master and its slaves. Replication therefore
provides fault-tolerance properties but no performance improvement.
</p>

<h2><a name="id16">6.1 Resetting the user password</a></h2><p>
When a MySQL service is started, a new user <tt>mysqldb</tt> is
created with a randomly-generated password. To gain access to the
database you must first reset this password. Click "Reset password"
in the front-end, and choose the new password.
</p>
<p>Note that the user password is <em>not</em> kept by the ConPaaS
frontend. If you forget the password the only thing you can do is
reset the password again to a new value.
</p>

<h2><a name="id17">6.2 Accessing the database</a></h2><p>
The frontend provides the command-line to access the database.
Copy-paste this command in a terminal. You will be asked for the user
password, after which you can use the database as you wish.
</p>
<p>Note that the <tt>mysqldb</tt> user has extended priviledges. It can
create new databases, new users etc.
</p>

<h2><a name="id18">6.3 Uploading a database dump to the MYSQL service</a></h2><p>
The ConPaaS frontend allows to easily upload database dumps to a MySQL service. Note that this functionality is restricted to dumps of a relatively small size. To upload larger dumps you can always use the regular mysql command for this:
</p>
<pre>
$ mysql mysql-ip-address -u mysqldb -p &lt; dumpfile.sql
</pre>

<h1><a name="id19">7 The Scalarix key-value store service</a></h1><p>
The Scalarix service provices an in-memory key-value store. It is
highly scalable and fault-tolerant. This service deviates slightly
from the organization of other services in that it does not have a
separate manager virtual machine instance. Scalarix is fully symmetric
so any scalarix node can act as a service manager.
</p>

<h2><a name="id20">7.1 Accessing the key-value store</a></h2><p>
Clients of the Scalarix service need the IP address of (at least) one
node to connect to the servicve. Copy-paste the address of any of the
running instances in the client. A good choice is the first instance
in the list: when scaling the service up and down, other instances may
be created or removed. The first instance will however remain across
these reconfigurations, until the service is terminated.
</p>

<h2><a name="id21">7.2 Managine the key-value store</a></h2><p>
Scalarix provides its own Web-based interface to monitor the state and
performance of the key-value store, manually add or query key-value
pairs, etc. For convenience reasons the ConPaaS front-end provides a
link to this interface.
</p>

<h1><a name="id22">8 The MapReduce service</a></h1><p>
The MapReduce service provides the well-known Apache Hadoop framework
in ConPaaS. Once the MapReduce service is created and started, the
front-end provides useful links to the Hadoop namenode, the job
tracker, and to a graphical interface which allows to upload/download
data to/from the service and issue MapReduce jobs.
</p>

<h1><a name="id23">9 Building new types of services</a></h1><p>
The architecture of ConPaaS allows developers to build new types of
services. To learn how to do this, please check the "Internals"
ConPaaS documentation.
