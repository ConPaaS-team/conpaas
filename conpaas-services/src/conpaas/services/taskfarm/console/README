The contents of this folder is required to run BaTS in stand-alone mode. 

This means that using the provided tools, one can simply execute BaTS on top
of bare OpenNebula installation or Amazon EC2.

You need to follow these steps for OpenNebula:

1) Update init.sh with your OpenNebula credentials as well as your XtreemFS 
path which contains the BaTS as well as required libraries in correct locations.
You also need to have the cluster configuration file (clusterConf.xml) as well
as the bag of task definition file (bagMountTest.bot) in a subdirectory called 
config in your XtreemFS volume.

2) Use generate_template.sh to create a final VM template out of template.vm 
and the modified init.sh. The generated template contains the hexed init.sh in
a contextualization variable.

3) Upload the generated template (final_template.vm) to your OpenNebula 
installation and issue a onevm create final_template.vm

The Manager will starts the sampling phase and then stops.

4) Connect to the Manager (con_bats) and look at the suggested schedules by 
executing list_sched.sh in $BATS_HOME.

5) Finally, start the execution phase by running execute_console.sh $sched 
where $sched is the number of preferred schedule returned from previous step.

to run on Amazon EC2:

1) Update clusterConf.xml to contain the credentials for your Amazon account. 
Use the same XML tags as the Eucalyptus clusters, but use ec2 for alias and 
EC2ClusterAmazonAPI class for reflection.

2) The default is using the t1.micro instances. Currently this is hardcoded in
 EC2ClusterAmazonAPI. You also need BaTS and libraries to be there in /root/BoT
 in the AMI which you are going to use. Minimal requirements for the AMI are a 
 java installation plus curl.
