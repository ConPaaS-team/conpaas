====================================
Script to build a ConPaaS disk image
====================================

Update file 'create-img-script.cfg' with your preferences.
Warning:
 * choosing 'debian_dist = wheezy'  the resulting image will not work, yet, there is still bugs to fix
 * only cloud 'ec2' with hypervisor 'xen',  and cloud 'opennebula' with hypervisor 'kvm' are supported

Then run script:
   ./create-img-script.py
it will generate file create-img-conpaas.sh

Then run that script as root
   sudo ./create-img-conpaas.sh |& tee image-creation.log


Default password for root is 'contrail'.


Mount locally the generated image:
  losetup -f -v file.img
  kpartx -a /dev/loopX
  mktemp -d
  mount -o loop file.img /tmp/tmp.dkfghdkfn
  
Unmount:
  umount /tmp/tmp.dkfghdkfn
  rm -rf /tmp/tmp.dkfghdkfn
  kpartx -d /dev/loopX
  losetup -d /dev/loopX
