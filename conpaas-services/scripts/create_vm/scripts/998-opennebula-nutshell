# Section: 997-opennebula

##### TO CUSTOMIZE: #####
# This part is for OpenNebula contextualization. The contextualization scripts (and possibly
# other necessary files) will be provided through OpenNebula to the VM as an ISO image.
# We need to mount this image and execute the contextualization scripts. You might need
# to change the dev file associated with the CD-ROM inside your virtual machine from
# "/dev/sr0" to something else (depending on your operating system and on the virtualization 
# software, it can be /dev/hdb, /dev/sdb etc.). You can check this in a VM that is already running
# in your OpenNebula system and that has been configured with contextualization.
