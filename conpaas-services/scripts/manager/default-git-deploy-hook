# This script enables GIT-based code/data uploads.
#
# The post-update hook defined here describes the behavior to be followed by
# the manager upon receiving a git-push(1). Rather than being invoked directly,
# this file should be sourced by the manager script. See for example
# php-manager-start in this same directory.

# Write the post-update hook
cat <<EOF>~git/code/hooks/post-update
#!/bin/sh
export PYTHONPATH=$CPS_HOME/src/:$CPS_HOME/contrib/ 
export CONPAAS_CERTS_DIR=$CERT_DIR 
python $CPS_HOME/bin/cpsclient.web.py http://127.0.0.1 git_push_hook

# Make it executable
chmod +x ~git/code/hooks/post-update

# Allow $ROOT_DIR traversal: cpsclient.web has to be accessed by the git user
chmod o+x $ROOT_DIR
