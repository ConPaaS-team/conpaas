This is how to create a tarball package out of this directory.

1. Checkout a fresh copy of this directory:

svn checkout svn+ssh://yourusername@svn.forge.objectweb.org/svnroot/contrail/conpaas/trunk 

2. Change the directory name "trunk" to something more meaningful such
   as "conpaas-0.1rc1".

3. Enter this directory, and delete the parts which should not be
   released. At the moment this are directories "base map-reduce
   scalaris bag-of-tasks sql".

4. Remove all directories ".svn":

   rm -Rf `find . -name .svn`

5. Rename directory "web-servers" into "ConPaaSWeb"
   (case-sensitive). Build a gzipped tarball of this directory, move
   the tarball to directory "frontend/code", then rename directory
   "ConPaaSWeb" back to "web-servers". (I know, this is ugly).

   mv web-servers ConPaaSWeb
   tar czvf ConPaaSWeb.tar.gz ConPaaSWeb
   mv ConPaaSWeb.tar.gz frontend/code/
   mv ConPaaSWeb web-servers

6. Copy all scripts from directory "web-servers/scripts" into
   "frontend/code": 

   cp web-servers/scripts/* frontend/code/

7. Download the AWS sdk for PHP from
   http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforphp/. Expand it and move it to
   directory "frontend/www/lib/aws-sdk/" such that file
   config-sample.inc.php is directly beneath it:

   wget http://pear.amazonwebservices.com/get/sdk-latest.zip
   unzip sdk-latest.zip
   mv sdk-1.4.2.1/sdk-1.4.2.1 frontend/www/lib/aws-sdk 
   rm -Rf sdk-1.4.2.1 sdk-latest.zip

8. Remove the file you are currently reading:
   rm PACKAGING-INSTRUCTIONS.txt

9. Move one directory up, and create the final tarball:
   tar czvf conpaas-0.1rc1.tar.gz conpaas-0.1rc1

10. That's it!
